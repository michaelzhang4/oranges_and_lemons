# 🍊 Oranges and Lemons 🍋
*A Market Making Game Based on Expected Value of Fruit*

## Overview
Pretty much just made a copy of my final round market making game for optiver, there is slight variation in expected fruits, number of trades and trade timeout to give it more replay value.
The way I was explained the game is to imagine that two teams are throwing oranges/lemons into a basket for 15 minutes and you are making trades on the expected number of oranges/lemons that land in the basket at the end of the game.
Super confusing to play for the first time and if you want to make a huge upside its just pure speculation. Bit harder to use calculate and adjust to new info and try to make consistent small +EV trades. 

You can get an idea of the expected value range by looking at the standard deviation and averages of each team before the game starts.
